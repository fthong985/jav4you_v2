        This usually happens if youâ€™ve clicked the download button multiple
        times. Wait for 1 minute, then try again. Refresh your browser to ensure
        the page works correctly.

        This is normal. Jav4You uses ads to cover the costs of running the site.
        Simply return to the Jav4You tab, and you can continue watching or
        downloading your video without losing progress.
